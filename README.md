## ‚ö†Ô∏è About Safety & Misconceptions

If you have **any doubts or suspicions**, feel free to upload the executable to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) or inspect the source code yourself. This project is **not a RAT**, trojan, or malicious in any way.

The term "**RAT**" is often misused to describe suspicious tools without understanding their function. This software does **not** provide remote access, steal data, or perform any background actions. It simply modifies Spotify's local configuration to disable ads.

- **Fully open source.** You can open the project in Visual Studio and inspect every line of code.
- **No network communication.** The tool does not connect to the internet.
- **No persistence.** It doesn't alter system registry or install startup services.
- **Only patches local files** (`dpapi.dll` and `config.ini`) inside Spotify's directory.
